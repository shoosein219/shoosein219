ğŸ¦  I am a microbiome data scientist working as a postdoc on soil microbiome/synthetic microbial community research at the Swiss Federation for Agricultural Research (Agroscope) in ZÃ¼rich

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about network analysis for microbiomes and neural networks for ML.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on metatranscriptomics and genome-resolved metagenomic bioinformatics for microbiome data analysis.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about NMR data analysis and how it can be incorporated into characterizing microbiome function.
